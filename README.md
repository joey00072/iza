iza is tiny container runtime (like Docker)

Running Container...
---------------------
/ # cat /etc/os-release  | grep NAME=
NAME="Alpine Linux"
PRETTY_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.19"
/ # 

```

## 
I was learning how conatiner works, Turn outs its just chroot and syscalls <br>


<br>
<br>

although this is tiny and not OCI compilent,it's still pretty powerfull <br>

you can run nginx with
